## Additional Notes

- Make sure to provide a valid playlist URL when using the script.
- `yt-dlp` must be installed for the script to run. It will prompt for installation if not found.
- For the thumbnail embedding functionality, additional dependencies might be required. On Arch Linux, for example, you may need to install the `atomicparsley` and/or `python-mutagen` packages to embed thumbnails in specific media formats. Ensure to check and install necessary packages for your operating system to make use of this feature.
